# Mock-SecurityPolicyReport
A mock security policy report I made for an imaginary start-up company called FinTech
Task Requirements: 
Scenario
myFinTech, a finance advisory startup, wants to revise its information security posture to so that customers
get uninterrupted and secure access to services provided by the company. These services are hosted at the
main data center at companyâ€™s Headquarter (HQ). Current network at the HQ consists of the following
appliances.
- Web Application Server (1)
- Router (1)
- Access point (2)
- Switch (1)
- Firewall (1)
- Manual IP addresses (172.19.0.0/16)
As cybersecurity professional, the Chief Security Officer (CSO) asked you to:
1- Revise the current security posture and identify the flaws in the current systems and infrastructure.
You need to categorize the severity of flaws into high, medium, and low.
2- Come up with a plan to mitigate the security flaws that are categorized as high and medium.
3- You are also required to build a security policy that covers all IT infrastructure and its components,
taking into consideration security awareness development.
4- Provide your recommendations to mitigate the identified flaws
